# 2025-10-01 IP address, Subnet, Ports

** DAY 1 ** 

** IP Address **
Today I have learned what actually IP address and use of it.
- It is a 32 bit numerical label used to uniquely identify devices over the network.
- Represented has: 198.168.28.10 (range 0-255) for each byte.

** Subnet mask **
- It divides IP address into small n/w helps to secure different departments like finance, etc.
- Uses CIDR notation to calculate number of subnet to assign - 198.168.3.2/24

** Ports ** 

# 2025-10-02 OSI MODEL & TCP/IP

** DAY 2 **
Today I explored OSI model, which explains how application or internet work through this 7 layer from 
Application Layer to Physical Layer and vice-versa.
- Each Layer work effectively to transmit the data smoothly.
- Understand the concept of TCP/IP which ensures reliable delivery in data.
- It has 5 layer which is actually used practically.
- TCP (HTTPS, SMTP) and UDP (DNS)

** Protocols **
- Rules that define how data is transferred over the network.
- HTTPS, FTP, DNS, POP3, IMAC, Telnet, TCP, UDP, SMTP

** DNS **
Domain Naming service it's basically a phonebook which helps to mapping letters to IP address.
- Ex: www.google.com -> 8.8.8.8
