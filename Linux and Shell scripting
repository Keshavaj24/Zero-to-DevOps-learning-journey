# Journey of Linux and shell scripting

Day 1 14-10-2025
#Shell Scripting & Linux commands
What I learned yesterday:
- Basics of Linux commands: mkdir, rmdir, touch, vi, ls, cd, chmod, cat, man, 
- Importance of shebang (#!/bin/bash) in shell scripts indicates a which interpreter to run that script.
- Created a simple automation shell script that: 
  1. Creates a folder 
  2. Creates files inside that folder 
- Understood why shell scripting is used: automation, integration, reusability, and saving time for 
  repetitive tasks. 

Experience: 
- Gained confidence using Linux commands and shell scripting for simple tasks.
